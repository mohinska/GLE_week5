This project provides a Python-based solution for filtering and displaying top-rated movies from a dataset. Users can specify the genre, release year, and number of top-rated movies they want to view. The application returns a list of movies that match the user’s criteria, ordered by rating in descending order.

Project Structure
- read_file(pathname: str, year: int=0)
Reads data from a specified file path, filtering movies from the year provided or later. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains details of a movie entry. If no year is provided, all entries are included.
- top_n(data: list, genre: str='', n: int=0)
Filters movies by genre and calculates a custom rating (actor rating) based on each actor’s highest-rated movie. For each movie, it then computes the average of the movie’s rating and the actors’ average ratings. The function returns a sorted list of tuples containing the movie title and average rating in descending order. The genre parameter accepts multiple genres separated by commas, performing an inclusive search for any specified genre.
- write_file(top: list, file_name: str)
Writes the list generated by top_n to a specified file, with each movie’s title and average rating on a separate line.
